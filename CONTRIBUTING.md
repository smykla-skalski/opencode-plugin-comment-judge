## Setting up

```sh
mise install      # node, oxlint, markdownlint-cli2, actionlint and zizmor at the pinned versions
mise run install  # npm ci from the lockfile
```

Tool versions are pinned in [`mise.toml`](mise.toml), so a local run and CI resolve the same binaries.

## The gate

```sh
mise run check
```

Typecheck, oxlint, markdownlint, actionlint with zizmor, the tests and the build. Every CI job runs one of these tasks, so a green local run and a green CI run mean the same thing. While you work, run the narrow one: `mise run test`, `mise run typecheck`, `mise run lint:js`, `mise run lint:md`, `mise run lint:actions` or `mise run build`.

`mise run test:e2e` is kept out of the gate because it needs `mise run install` and takes a few seconds per case. It installs the `opencode-ai` pinned in [`test/e2e/package.json`](test/e2e/package.json) into `test/e2e/node_modules`, so `mise run install` and the other CI jobs never download the opencode binary. It runs that opencode headless in a scratch project with this checkout loaded as a plugin, against a fake model server, and checks that a judge's rewrite reaches the file on disk through `edit` and `apply_patch`, and that `/judge-comments` reports a branch's comment and applies the suggestion without judging it again. Run it after touching `src/index.ts`, `src/changes.ts`, `src/judge.ts` or `src/branch.ts`, and on every opencode bump, which moves `opencode-ai` there and `@opencode-ai/plugin` in the root `package.json` together. CI runs it in its own job.

No lint suppressions. If a rule is wrong for a case, raise it in the pull request.

## What a change carries

- **A test.** Tests live in [`test/`](test), one file per module. Write the test first and watch it fail.
- **Evidence for prompt changes.** A change to the judge instructions in [`src/judge.ts`](src/judge.ts) names the verdicts it fixes, and carries the `mise run eval` table from before and after the change for the models it was tried on. Link the wrong-verdict issues, or paste the before and after from a `log` file.
- **A case for every wrong verdict.** Each reported wrong verdict becomes a case in [`eval/cases/`](eval/cases), so a later prompt change cannot bring it back unnoticed.
- **Comments that say why.** Never what. This project in particular has no excuse.
- **README updates.** If the change makes a claim in the [README](README.md) false, fix it in the same pull request.

To try a change inside opencode, use [`scripts/try.sh`](scripts/try.sh).

## Replaying the eval cases

```sh
mise run eval -- --model anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5 --model openai/gpt-5-mini
mise run eval -- --model anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5 --case rewrite-ts-bug-story --runs 5 --json
```

[`scripts/eval.ts`](scripts/eval.ts) starts `opencode serve` from your `PATH` with your normal opencode config and providers, and sends every case in [`eval/cases/`](eval/cases) through the plugin's own `judge()`, so it exercises the production prompt. For each model it prints agreement with the expected actions, overall and per action, latency p50 and p95, total cost, failures (timeouts and unreadable answers, which count as not agreeing), and every disagreement with the model's reason. `--runs n` repeats each case to show how much verdicts vary between runs. It exits 0 even with disagreements. CI does not run it, because it needs provider credentials; `mise run test` validates every case file.

A case is one JSON file named after it:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `file` | Path with an extension; it picks the comment syntax |
| `comment` | The comment as written, with its markers; indentation may be left out |
| `context` | The code around it after the edit, containing the comment |
| `task` | Optional prompt the agent was given |
| `rules` | Optional repository rules, as in `.comment-judge.md` |
| `expected` | `keep`, `remove` or `rewrite` |
| `why` | One line on why that is the right answer |

## Commits

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) with a required scope, a title of 50 characters or fewer, imperative, with no issue reference. Sign and sign off: `git commit -s -S`.

Scopes inside `src/` name the module: `judge`, `comments`, `changes`, `rewrite`, `messages`, `options`, `rules`, `plugin`, `evaluate`, `branch` for the `judge_comments` tool and `/judge-comments` command with `diff` and `git` behind them, and `claude` for everything under `src/claude/`. Outside it: `ci(actions)`, `ci(release)`, `build(build)`, `docs(readme)`, `test(<module>)`, `chore(deps)`.

## Pull requests

Small and single-purpose. `main` takes squash merges, and the pull request title becomes the commit that release-please reads, so it follows the commit rules above. The template asks for three sections: Motivation, Implementation information and Supporting documentation. Say which validation you ran, specifically.

## Releasing

Update `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `CHANGELOG.md` and the pinned examples in `README.md` through a pull request. After CI passes and the PR merges, create a GitHub Release tagged `vX.Y.Z` from the merge commit. The tag must match `package.json` and point to a commit on `main`.

The [release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) runs `mise run check` and publishes to npm through [trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers). The provenance attestation names `smykla-skalski/opencode-plugin-comment-judge`, `.github/workflows/release.yml` and the release tag. While the repository variable `NPM_PUBLISH_ENABLED` is not `true`, the publish job only runs `npm publish --dry-run`.

### Setting up publishing for a new package or a fork

npm cannot configure a trusted publisher for a package name that has never been published ([npm/cli#8544](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/8544)), so the first scoped version is published by hand. CI publishes later versions. In a fork, substitute your package name and repository.

1. Create an environment named `npm` in the repository settings, and permit only release tags matching `v*`.
2. Set `NPM_PUBLISH_ENABLED` to `false`. Merge the release PR, create the GitHub Release, and confirm the publish job stops at the dry run.
3. Publish that version from the maintainer's npm account. Check out the tag, run `mise run install`, then log in and publish:

   ```sh
   mise exec -- npm login
   mise exec -- npm publish --access public --provenance=false
   ```

   `--provenance=false` overrides `publishConfig.provenance`, because provenance can only be generated in CI. Publishing asks for 2FA: with a security key, run it in a real terminal, since it waits for approval in the browser; with an authenticator app, add `--otp=<code>`.
4. Add the trusted publisher. With npm 11.15 or later, and 2FA again:

   ```sh
   mise exec -- npm trust github \
     @smykla-skalski/opencode-plugin-comment-judge \
     --file release.yml --repo smykla-skalski/opencode-plugin-comment-judge \
     --env npm --allow-publish
   ```

   Or on npmjs.com, in the package settings: GitHub Actions, the repository, workflow `release.yml`, environment `npm`. npm grants it publish and stage publish.
5. In the package settings on npmjs.com, set publishing access to "Require two-factor authentication and disallow tokens". CI publishes through the trusted publisher, so no npm token is needed anywhere.
6. Set the repository variable `NPM_PUBLISH_ENABLED` to `true`. Future GitHub Releases publish through OIDC with provenance.
